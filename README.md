# Planning

My goal during this project was to make a game that was simple and fun to play, visually pleasing, and gives the user a nostalgic feeling, at least for those of us born before the invention of the internet.

## User Stories

* As a user i can see a discription of the game when the page is loaded so that i know how to play.
* As a user i can click on cards to turn them over so that i can see what card it is.
* As a user i can click on a button that starts the game so i can choose when to start.
* As a user i can view a tracker that keeps time and moves played so that i can improve my score.
* As a user i can click on social media links so that i can tell people about my score.
* As a user i can play and view the game easily on multiple devices
  
## Design

For the games design, as it is a card game using a classic deck of cards, i wanted to give it a classic look. I chose to go with the red and green that we all remember from games like poker, or solitair. The classic red back contrasts well on the green background, almost as if they are lying on a poker table with green feldt. I chose a simple font "Arial", as i wanted the website to be clean and sleek, so that nothing is a distraction from the game itself. The game is centered on the page so it it easy to focus on, and the dropback is a light floral pattern wich is quietly pleasing without drawing away attention from the game itself.

# Deployment

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  * Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
